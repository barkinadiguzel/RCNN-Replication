# RCNN-Replication
This repository provides a theoretical replication of the original R-CNN architecture, focusing solely on the model’s structural components without training or evaluation code. It implements region proposals, ROI warping, convolutional feature extraction, and fully connected heads to illustrate the end-to-end pipeline of classic R-CNN.
